## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a chapter from the perspective of the 'London Memory' itself—the consciousness of the witness to Charles I's execution, aware it is housed in a dying Frenchman.
- Create a side-story about Élise, the archivist, discovering a hidden journal in the library that details a failed 17th-century experiment in 'consciousness transfer'.
- Write a philosophical dialogue between Armand and a hallucinated version of John Locke, debating whether identity requires memory continuity or merely consciousness.
- Craft a 'lost chapter' where Armand experiences a fleeting, invasive memory that is not his own, forcing him to confront the phenomenon firsthand.

### Technical Entry Points

- Build an interactive 'Memory Atlas' that maps the connections between the novel's characters and the invasive memories they carry, visualizing the network of consciousness.
- Design a text-generation model trained on Enlightenment philosophical texts to generate new 'impossible memories' in the style of the novel, as potential expansions.
