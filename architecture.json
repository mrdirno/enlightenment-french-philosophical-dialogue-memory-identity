  "cover_prompt": "A gaunt, dying man sits upright in a threadbare armchair, his translucent form superimposed over a spectral parliament of his own fading memories, each ghostly figure debating in silent, urgent gestures within the crumbling library of his mind. The scene is set in a dim, 18th-century French study at midnight, with philosophical treatises and dusty folios floating like ghosts, and a single, impossible window showing a starless void, embodying the fragility of inherited consciousness. In the atmospheric style of Caspar David Friedrich meets the psychological etchings of William Blake, with the chiaroscuro depth of Rembrandt and the symbolic weight of traditional allegorical painting. Book cover framing, centered composition with the dying man as the focal point, viewed from a low, dramatic angle as if the viewer is a supplicant before this metaphysical court. Dramatic tenebrism lighting with a single candle guttering on a desk, casting long, conflicting shadows from the multiple ghostly selves, using a somber color palette of deep umbers, burnt sienna, and ethereal cool greys with faint, ghostly cerulean highlights. masterpiece, best quality, ultra detailed, intricate details, professional composition, sharp focus, 8k resolution, flux dev."
